Excercise I.
a. O(1)
b. O(log n)
c. O(n^3)
d. O(n^2)
e. O(n^4)
f. O(n)
g. O(n)
Excercise II.
a. To design a linear running time algorithm the array is inserted into the function and the function interates through each number within the array and stores the number as it goes through the array the larger number replaces the number if it is larger and returns the largest value.
b. Create function OperationBrokenEgg that iterates through each story begginning from the bottom floor and then drops an egg from each story, while the egg remains unbroken the function would move up a story then when the egg finally breaks that becomes f. 
Excercise III.
a. The run time algorithm is the same as the function goes through the entire array either way.
b. The run time algorithm is the same as the function even though it begins in the middle it iterates through the entire function either way.
